# Show my reviews in ConfTool overview page

This JavaScript bookmarklet shows your saved reviews in the ConfTool overview page.

1. Create a new bookmark in your browser
2. Choose any name
3. Copy the content of `showMyReviews.bookmarklet.js` as its adress
4. Save it
5. Navigate to your ConfTool website with the overview page of all your reviews, e.g. https://www.conftool.com/oat21/index.php?page=browseAssignedPapers&form_track=0
6. Click on the newly created bookmarklet in your browser twice (first time will enrich the site with your reviews, second time will then do the reordering)

The javascript code goes all your reviews and copy the grades as well as any comments into the overview pages. This happens purely in your browser at the current session. Whenever you reload the website, you will see again the normal overview from ConfTool.

The bookmarklet code is only a rewrite of the fully formatted javascript code also below using [this online tool](https://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet/).
